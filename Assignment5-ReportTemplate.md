# Introduction
This lab consists of analyzing test data through reliability assessment tools. We will be assessing failure data via reliability growth testing and a reliability demonstration chart (RDC). We will be using C-SFRAT to analyze the reliability growth of the given test data and SRTAT to analyze the reliability demonstration chart.

# Comparison of Results
From the plots in part one, an estimation of a failure intensity objective can be drawn. We can see from the plots that the least number of failures is at 0 intervals and the most failures are at the final interval. With this, we can calculate the slope of a linear failure intensity objective. Here, the final interval has accumulated roughly 95 failures. Given that this is the 30th interval, we can calculate a slope of 95/30=3.2 . This gives us a very rough estimate of the minimum failure intensity objective to ensure the failure data is accepted. In part two, we calculated that the minimum failure intensity objective to accept the failure data was 3, so these results are fairly close. It should also be noted that our approximation made for part 1 is linear and the region in intervals 18-20 still fall underneath the interval, so this estimation is certainly higher than the actual value. 
# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques
Similarities
Both techniques allowed us to analyze the failure rates of the test data visually with reference to expected values. 
Differences
Performing reliability growth testing allowed us to visualize the entire data set over its time range while the RDC only allowed us to compare the test data with accepting and rejecting conditions.
Reliability growth testing focuses on increasing the systems reliability to a desired point, whereas RDC is focused on showcasing the reliability of the system

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
For this lab, we divided the work into two sections (part one and two) and had two team members working on each part. For the reliability growth testing, one person used C-SFRAT and created graphs while the other person analyzed the graphs and wrote descriptions. We followed a similar strategy for the reliability demonstration chart.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
All difficulties encountered involved the provided software files. SRTAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart Excel sheet did not work as they are set out to in the lab handout. This is discussed in further detail in the feedback section. In the end, we had to use C-SFRAT for part one and SRTAT for part two.
# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
This lab has honestly been the most difficult, solely due to technical difficulties with the resources provided. The SRTAT did not accept the CSV file that was provided in the lab artifacts and even after aimlessly reformatting the data set, the SRTAT program failed to execute. The other programs that were mentioned were also tested and either did not work on MAC or failed to accept the data set. Since there were minimal instructions given in the lab document, this was a difficult issue to navigate. This rendered some team members useless, so their attention was redirected to part 2 of the document. After reading the RDC document and opening the excel sheet, the instructions seemed fairly straight forward, except that the document did not have the expected functionality. As most of the document was in a protected view, most of the instructions were impossible to complete. It was impossible to add data into the cumulative failure count column which was particularly important.
